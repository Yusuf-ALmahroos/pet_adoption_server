# Pet Adoption Server

This is a backend server for a pet adoption platform, built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB (Mongoose). It provides a RESTful API for managing users, pets, adoption requests, and comments.

## Features

*   **User Management**:
    *   User registration and login.
    *   Password hashing and JWT-based authentication.
    *   Update user passwords.
    *   Session checking.
*   **Pet Management**:
    *   Create, read, update, and delete pet listings.
    *   View all available pets.
    *   View pets owned by a specific user (shelter owner).
*   **Adoption Requests**:
    *   Users can create adoption requests for pets.
    *   View personal adoption requests.
    *   Shelter owners can view and respond to adoption requests for their pets (approve/reject).
    *   Pets are marked as `isAdopted` upon approval of a request.
*   **Comments**:
    *   Users can create comments on pet listings.
    *   View comments for a specific pet.
    *   Update and delete personal comments.

## Technologies Used

*   **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment.
*   **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js.
*   **MongoDB**: NoSQL database.
*   **Mongoose**: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Yusuf-ALmahroos/pet_adoption_server.git
    cd pet_adoption_server
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Environment Variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:
    ```
    MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    SALT_ROUNDS=10 # Or any integer for bcrypt salt rounds
    APP_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
    ```
    Replace `your_mongodb_connection_string` with your MongoDB connection URI (e.g., `mongodb://localhost:27017/petadoption`).
    Replace `your_jwt_secret_key` with a strong, random string.

4.  **Start the server**:
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```
    The server will typically run on `http://localhost:3000` (or the port configured in `server.js`).

## API Endpoints

Below is a summary of the main API endpoints. All authenticated routes require a JWT in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.

### Authentication (`/auth`)

*   `POST /auth/register`: Register a new user.
*   `POST /auth/login`: Log in a user and receive a JWT.
*   `PUT /auth/update/:user_id`: Update user password (authenticated).
*   `GET /auth/session`: Check user session (authenticated).

### Pets (`/pets`)

*   `GET /pets`: Get all pets.
*   `GET /pets/me`: Get pets owned by the authenticated user (shelter owner) (authenticated).
*   `GET /pets/:id`: Get a pet by ID (authenticated).
*   `POST /pets`: Create a new pet listing (authenticated).
*   `PUT /pets/:id`: Update a pet listing (authenticated, owner only).
*   `DELETE /pets/:id`: Delete a pet listing (authenticated, owner only).

### Adoption Requests (`/adoption-requests`)

*   `POST /adoption-requests`: Create a new adoption request (authenticated).
*   `GET /adoption-requests/my`: Get adoption requests made by the authenticated user (authenticated).
*   `GET /adoption-requests/received`: Get adoption requests received for the authenticated user's pets (authenticated, owner only).
*   `GET /adoption-requests/respond/:requestId`: Respond to an adoption request (approve/reject) (authenticated, owner only).

### Comments (`/comments`)

*   `POST /comments`: Create a new comment on a pet (authenticated).
*   `GET /comments/pet/:petId`: Get all comments for a specific pet.
*   `PUT /comments/:commentId`: Update a comment (authenticated, owner only).

## Usage Example (using `curl`)

### Register a User

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com", "password": "password123"}' http://localhost:3001/auth/register
```

### Login a User

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email": "john@example.com", "password": "password123"}' http://localhost:3000/auth/login
```
(This will return a JWT token that you can use for authenticated requests)

### Create a Pet (as a shelter owner)

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_JWT_TOKEN>" -d '{"name": "Buddy", "type": "Dog", "breed": "Golden Retriever", "age": 2, "description": "Friendly and playful.", "image": "http://example.com/buddy.jpg"}' http://localhost:3000/pets
```

### Create an Adoption Request

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_JWT_TOKEN>" -d '{"petId": "60c72b2f9b1e8c001c8e4d7a", "message": "I would love to adopt Buddy!"}' http://localhost:3000/adoption-requests
```
